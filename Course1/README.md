# Course 1 – Python Basics

This folder contains mini-projects I built while learning the fundamentals of Python.  
Each project focuses on core concepts like variables, input/output, loops, and conditionals.

## 📂 Projects

1. **Calculator**  
   - Performs basic arithmetic operations like **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **division**,**exponents**,**modulus**.
   - [Calculator](calculator.py)
   
‎**📝 What I learned:**
‎- How to take user input and convert it to numbers.  
‎- Using conditionals (`if` / `elif` / `else`) to perform different operations.  
‎- Handling invalid choices with simple error checks.  

‎
‎**⚡ What was difficult for me:**  
‎- Remembering when to use `elif` vs multiple `if` statements.  
‎- Making sure division worked correctly (e.g., dividing by zero issue).  

‎
‎**✅ What I improved:**
‎- Got comfortable with conditional chains
-Learned how to use `try/except` effectively.      


2. **Even-Odd Finder**  
   - Checks if a number is odd or even.
   - [Even-Odd Finder](even_odd_finder.py)

‎**📝 What I learned:**  
‎- Using the modulus operator (`%`) to check divisibility.  
‎- Wrapping code in a loop so the program runs multiple times until the user quits.  

‎
‎**⚡ What was difficult for me:** 
‎- Handling invalid input (letters, symbols) without crashing the program.  
‎- Deciding when to use `break` vs `continue`. 

‎
‎**✅ What I improved:**  
‎- Made the program user-friendly with a repeat option.  


3. **Multiplication Table Generator**  
   - Generates the multiplication table of a number.  
   - Can choose how far the table goes (e.g., up to 10, 20, etc.).
   - [Multiplication Table Generator](multiplication_table_generator.py)

‎**📝 What I learned:** 
‎- Defining and calling a function with parameters.  
‎- Looping through a range of numbers (`while`) and incrementing values.

‎
‎**⚡ What was difficult for me:** 
‎- At first, I returned values instead of printing inside the function, which stopped my loop from working correctly.  
‎- I also misplaced `num2 = num2 + 1` outside the loop, which caused an infinite loop. 

‎
‎**✅ What I improved:**  
‎- Understood the difference between `print` and `return`.  
‎- Fixed my loop logic and indentation errors.  
‎- Gained confidence in defining and using functions.  
‎

4. **Number Guessing Game** 
   - Guesses a random number until correct.  
   - Practice with loops and conditions.
